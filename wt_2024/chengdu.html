                <h2>2: 21 December 2023</h2>
		<h3>"hé wǒ zài chéngdū de jiētóu zǒu yī zǒu"</h3>
		<p>There are approximately one and a half days before I fly overseas. To put things shortly, I do not feel prepared!</p>
		<p>I made up a lot of BS on my Winter Term application to get it accepted, including that I would be "practicing my instruments" which I have not been. Today after the last of the remaining people who I knew left campus, I had nothing to do so I figured I would actually try to stick to the plan a bit and practice playing my bari uke.</p>
		<p>A song that I've had stuck in and out of my head for the past few weeks is Chengdu by Zhao Lei. I can't remember when I first heard it, but listening to it triggers something nostalgic in me, so it was probably when I was quite young. When I listen to people speaking (or singing) Mandarin above a very basic level, I can't understand most of it. I can distinguish between the tones, and they sound like words and not gibberish, I just don't know the meaning of most of the words and phrases. In Chengdu, I could understand the first line of the chorus, as it was pretty simple- "Walk with me through the streets of Chengdu". The rest of the song's lyrics were always more muddled for me when I listened.</p>
		<p>A friend of mine mentioned seeing a list of the Gayest Cities in China. When I looked it up, I found that Chengdu was commonly considered to be #1 in that respect. I have no idea if the songwriter of Chengdu, Zhao Lei, is gay in any way, but the song (like most generic love songs) can be interpreted to be about gay yearning, so I choose to do so.</p>
		<p>I decided to learn to play Chengdu as practice, and also maybe to show off and impress my relatives in China. The chords were available online and fairly standard. I was also able to find a pinyin transcription of the lyrics, so I could learn them.</p>
		<p>Pinyin is an interesting system. Because I can pronounce tones, and I know which sounds the tone markers and English letters correspond to, I can read pinyin and sound like a native speaker saying the words, but I don't actually understand what most of them say. As I practiced singing and memorizing the lyrics to Chengdu, I had a sense of the uncanny valley feeling. On the surface, I could pronounce the words quite well, but I had only the vaguest idea what I was singing about. This lack of understanding also severely hindered my ability to memorize the words. Without actually comprehending what I was singing, I was just trying to memorize a seemingly random order of syllables with brute force.</p>
		<p>The more I closely listened to the words though, the more I realized I understood more than I thought. The melody had obscured some of the tones, making them harder to understand, but speaking them out loud, I realized I was saying intelligible sentences. Looking up an English translation helped further. After doing this more careful practice, I realized that maybe 75% of the song was made up of words that I was able to understand all along.</p>
		<p>The song describes the rainy, willowy city of Chengdu where the singer's lover remains, separated from the singer. In my seasonal depression brought on by winter in Ohio, it painted a tantalizing image in my mind. Unfortunately, I will be in Beijing, which is quite far from Chengdu and even colder than Ohio at this time. Out of curiosity, I did look up the weather in Chengdu, which at around 45-60 F highs is much balmier than Beijing's highs of 25-30 F.</p>
		<p>I've been quite homesick for Davis, which is strange because I've never really been homesick before. I wish I were going somewhere sunnier and warmer, and I am nervous to be in cold Beijing for a month. I wish I could go for a walk down the partially cloudy, 49 F streets of Chengdu with all of my friends.</p>
