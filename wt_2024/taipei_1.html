                <h2>3: 25 December 2023</h2>
		<h3>"Closed on Mondays"</h3>
		<p>Merry Christmas! I landed in Taipei early Christmas morning for a 10-hour layover. Getting to explore the city was a lot of fun and I can't wait to do it again on my return flight, although I will have a shorter layover.</p>
		<p>I wanted to include pictures I took in this blog post, but I haven't yet figured out how to get a VPN on my laptop from behind the Great Firewall, so transferring the images from my phone is tricky. I'll just do my best to describe and maybe add them later.</p>
		<p>At the Taoyuan Airport, I ran into a friend and fellow queer Asian Obie! This was an insane coincidence, given that we were on separate planes (I got lost in the airport for about 3 hours, and that's the only reason we ran into each other). After going through immigration, we went our separate ways.</p>
		<p>In Taipei, I saw lots of cool birds that don't exist in Ohio or Norcal. I also saw some sparrows that looked very familiar. North America is overrun by invasive House Sparrows that were introduced from Eurasia, and these sparrows looked a lot like those except they were probably native. I don't know that much about Taiwanese birds. I started out walking mostly randomly. I happened across MOCA, an art museum. It was closed, and apparently it is closed every Monday.</p>
		<p>In the spirit of this blog's theme, I went looking for gay. Unfortunately, I am an American who is not at all familiar with what gay culture looks like outside of the West. I did see some signs and accessories with rainbows on them, but they could have just been rainbows.</p>
		<p>I wanted to visit the National Library and look for queer literature, but it was closed. Maybe it was Christmas, or maybe it was a Monday. Across the street was the Memorial to Chiang Kai-shek, and the National Theater and National Concert Hall, which were all open. The National Theater contained a small cafe-bookshop, which I browsed through in lieu of the library. Most of the books were film or theater related, but I did find copies of The Picture of Dorian Gray (by Oscar Wilde), Selected Works of Oscar Wilde, Gender Troubles (by Judith Butler), and Histoire de la Sexualit√® (by Michel Foucault). I wasn't surprised per se to find them, but it was a very small bookshop that had a strong focus on theater, so it was a little unexpected. These are all books written in English (or French) translated into Chinese. I wish I could read Hanzi, so I could spot gay books originally written in Chinese. One book did catch my eye because of its prominently displayed "18+" sticker as well as the use of the bottom emoji (you know the one) in the subtitle. When I have more energy I'll properly look into it, but for now, the Google Translate version of its title is "Until night gentle: can you treat me like a normal person?" Some partially English fine print advertises a "Sex Chat Podcast". I definitely intend to do more research on this book and its author (authors?), but probably when I have a better internet connection. The bookstore also had a translated book by Jordan Peterson.</p>
		<p>The National Concert Hall had a gender-neutral bathroom. I didn't take a photo (that would have been weird) but I did use it even though I didn't really have to, just because. It felt notable because it was the only bathroom in that area of the building, and it wasn't just a single-stall room, it was a normal public bathroom with multiple stalls shared by all genders. That puts it above the Cleveland Airport in terms of gendered bathrooms. Probably also the Seattle Airport as well, whose only gender-neutral bathrooms I could find were the big family bathrooms.</p>
		<p>I'm actually writing this blog post on December 28, so I've had several days to think about how to write it. I had some poetic meaningful stuff in mind but I'm tired and still slightly jetlagged so I just tried to put down the important things that happened. Maybe I'll write a better blog post about my layover in Taipei on the way back.</p>
