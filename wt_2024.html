			<h2>Intro</h2>
			<p>Hi! This is where I'm going to be "blogging" (as the kids say) about my Winter Term 2024 experience in China. This is not the offical journal that I'm turning in as part of my Winter Term deliverables, but I wanted to have a place to write down thoughts that are unrelated to my main project (which is teaching preschoolers English and music) or thoughts that were too unhinged. I will call this blog</p>
			<h3>Reed Documents His Side Project About Looking For Queerness In China With Poorly-Written, Poorly-Edited Journal Entries</h3>
			<p>Prepare for bad writing, over-sentimentality, bad metaphors, and me trying to seem cool. Also prepare for me abandoning this project after one (1) week when I get bored. We'll see!</p>
