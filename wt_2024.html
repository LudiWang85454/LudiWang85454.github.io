		<p>Hi! This is where I'm going to be "blogging" (as the kids say) about my Winter Term 2024 experience in China. This is not the offical journal that I'm turning in as part of my Winter Term deliverables, but I wanted to have a place to write down my thoughts where other people might read them. Specifically my thoughts about being gay and trans. I will be calling this blog</p>

		<p>I am not a writer! Prepare for bad writing, over-sentimentality, bad metaphors, and me trying to seem cool. Also prepare for me abandoning this project after one (1) week when I get bored. We'll see!</p>
